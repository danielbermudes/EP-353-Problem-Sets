# *Daniel's Csound Notelist Piece*

Hello! The following project is a short demonstration of implementing Csound into the C Programming Language. While there are many ways to run Csound in C, this project relies on multiple instances of `fprintf` statements to generate instrument lines and function tables.

At the end of the day, Csound is a powerful tool for music making. This project hopes to demonstrate how unique and inspiring Csound can be in any format, even from within a C program!


To compile and run this program, type the following command into Terminal (be sure that Terminal is looking within the same folder the files are in):

	gcc -o DBScore DBScore.c && ./DBScore
	
The piece will then play through and when it is finished, it will stop.
