# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

*Daniel's Csound Notelist Piece*

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "My project is about creating a web-based synthesizer.")

My project will be about creating a short notelist compositional piece from Csound, utilzing C has a host for Csound.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

In detail, this project will execute an original notelist piece around 2 ~ 3 minutes in length (like a typical song). It will carry basic instruments like percussion, bass, and keys sounds. The instruments themselves will be imbedded into a `.csd` file that will then be called and executed witin a `.c` file. 

## If you are planning to combine EP-353's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to EP-353, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

I won't necessarily be combining this final project with another course's final project. The instruments utilized in Csound would obviously come from EP-337, but hosting and compiling/running the actual `.csd` file in C would be related to EP-353.

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

No matter what happens during these next weeks, I will certainly have a piece that generates sound. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

I think I can implement global audio processing effects such as reverb and delay into the piece.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

I hope to create a piece that is arguably 'musical' and not necessarily a collage of different sounds.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research?

I will need to learn how to incorporate Csound codes into the C programming langauge. That will be better explored by referencing Ben Houge's *GranularDemos2* project, where he implements his own `.csd` file without having to use the Csound API.
