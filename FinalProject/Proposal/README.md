# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

*Daniel's Csound Notelist Piece*

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "My project is about creating a web-based synthesizer.")

My project will be about creating a notelist compositional piece, utilzing syntax and commands found in the C programming language.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

In detail, this project will execute an original notelist piece around 2 ~ 3 minutes in length (like a typical song). It will be completed in CsoundQt, and utilize C syntax and commands such as `if` statements, and `for` and `while` loops. Following in the style of Shengzheng Zhang's original notelist piece, this project will use arrays to generate chord structures and melodies that will be called in the score section.

## If you are planning to combine EP-353's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to EP-353, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

I won't necessarily be combining this final project with another course's final project. The final for this course will take information learned in EP-337 to help complete the piece, but the final for EP-337 is a seperate and different project.

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

No matter what happens during these next weeks, I will certainly have a note-list piece that generates sound. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

I think I can implement global audio processing effects such as reverb and delay into the notelist piece.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

I hope to assign MIDI controllable parameters to change the sound of the notelist piece in real-time. Also I believe now there is a feature to do live coding, so I want to try and create a mini live performance with the notelist piece.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research?

I will need to analyze how to incorporate traditional C programming language into Csound since much of Csound is controlled by opcodes. Studying other pieces like Shengzheng Zhang's will help me better understand how to implement it. Also, I have to learn how to actually do live coding with Csound.
