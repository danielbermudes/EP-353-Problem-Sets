### Purpose
The purpose of this problem set was to understand how to use GitHub, Markdown, and compile a C program using CLI.

### Description
The Problem Set 1.1 covered how to use the Git version control system with GitHub. I had to learn the basic terminology, such as commit, pull, and push, used in Git/GitHub to understand how to version control software. The Problem Set 1.2 was about writing documentation using Markdown. In it, we were required to use syntax such as `#`, `*`, and `--` to format the `README.md` file so that the file is formatted nicely on GitHub when it is displayed. Finally, the Problem Set 1.3 was about writing a C program that prints out "Hello World". I had to make sure that the program compiled and ran through CLI.

### Build and Run Commands
The Problem Set 1.1 and 1.2 do not require any build and run commands. To build Problem Set 1.3, use:

	clang helloworld.c -o helloworld

To run the compiled `helloworld` program, use:

	./helloworld
	
### Acknowledgement
I used the [Markdown Cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) on GitHub to figure out the syntax for Markdown.
